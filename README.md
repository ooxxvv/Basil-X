Smoke theme base on Mint-Y-Theme

### License
 * Base on Mint-Y theme of Linux Mint - Xfce (https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-y-theme)

Editing
=======

Do not make modifications to the theme directly in the usr/share/themes directory. These are automatically generated from the files located in the src/ directory. Each subdirectory contains its own individual instructions on how to edit. Once edits are made you can generate the final themes by running the build-themes.py script.
